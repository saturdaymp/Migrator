Migrator is Awesome!  Itâ€™s a database migration tool inspired by the [Ruby on Rails migration](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html) process.  Use it to migrate database changes between developers and then migrate those changes to the UAT, staging, and production databases.

Boom! Done!
