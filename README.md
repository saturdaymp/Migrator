Migrator is Awesome!  Itâ€™s a database migration tool inspired by the [Ruby on Rails migration](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html) process.  Use it to migrate database changes between developers and then migrate those changes to the UAT, staging, and production databases.

Boom! Done!

## Documentation

Migrator documentation and a quickstart guide can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/saturdaymp/Migrator/wiki).

## Versioning

Migrator uses [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/) to automatically generate version numbers based on the state of the Git repository. The versioning scheme follows trunk-based development with release branches:

- The `main` branch contains the latest development version and will produce versions like `1.2.3-ci.1`
- Release branches (`release-*`) contain stable versions and will produce versions like `1.2.3-beta.1`
- Tags are used to mark specific releases

The GitVersion configuration can be found in [GitVersion.yml](GitVersion.yml).
